 The Top 3 was selected here though we can see a tie from the first 2.

Q7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more
To arraive at this answer, i had to create a column showing the products and classifying them into those that qualify for 50% or more using "Yes or No" as a basis.
A Count of 660 products was identified using COUNTIF function.

Q8 Distribution of product ratings
This views how products are rated by customers and this usually takes the form of a count and it spreads across different levels. 
It provides a more detailed view of customer sentiment than just an average rating, revealing whether most customers had a positive, negative, or mixed experience.  The spread we have for Amazon is between 2.3 - 5 using rating.

Q9. Total potential revenue by category
Here, Turnover on each category is analysed using actual price and rating count as basis.
The highest turnover is  ₹ 1,324,736,000.00 which is from SanDisk 1TB Extreme Portable SSD 1050MB/s R, 1000MB/s W

Q10 Number of unique products per price range bucket
Amazon has some unique products which a price  range bucket was created for as a separate column.

Discount price was used here and i was able to sort between "₹200–₹500" as the price range bucket.
Products whose price was  ₹200-₹500 were 341, products whose price was <₹200 was 158 and products >₹500 were 849.

Q 11 How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
To bring out the relationship between rating and discount, i had to group discount into band i.e  0-10%, 11-20%.., and upon completion, a comparison was done based on average rating per discount band.
Those that fell in the discount band of <50% had average rating of 4.127034884 while those that were 50% or More had average rating of 4.055454545

Q12 How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews

192 Amazon products were identified having < 1000 reviews and this was accomplished using the COUNT function

rts [2 Pack] Mini USB C Type C Adapter Plug, Type C Female to USB A Male Charger Charging Cable Adapter Converter compatible for iPhone. This product was identified with 94% discount.
Potential revenue on this product is  ₹ 22,125,574.00 an it is possible this is a fast moving product.
